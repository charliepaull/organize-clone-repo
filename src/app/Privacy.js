				Security
			</h2>
			<p className="c_privacy__text">
				We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, 
				your information is protected both online and offline.
			</p>
			<p className="c_privacy__text">
				Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and 
				transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking 
				for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.
			</p>
			<p className="c_privacy__text">
				While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. 
				Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are 
				granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable 
				information are kept in a secure environment.			
			</p>
			<h2 className="c_privacy__subtitle">

				In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is 
				required to give certain information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact 
				you about the products/services on our site in which you have expressed interest. At your option, you may also 
				provide demographic information (such as gender or age) about yourself, but it is not required.

				Cookies
			</h2>
			<p className="c_privacy__text">
				We reserve the right to use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard 
				drive to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a 
				cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. 
				Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 
				Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site.				
			</p>

			<h2 className="c_privacy__subtitle">
				Sharing
			</h2>
			<p className="c_privacy__text">
				We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any 
				personal information that can identify any individual person.				
			</p>
			<p className="c_privacy__text">
				We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods 
				and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for 
				any secondary purposes beyond filling your order.
			</p>
			<p className="c_privacy__text">
				We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share 
				names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties 
				are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

				practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy 
				statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.

				Surveys and Contests
			</h2>
