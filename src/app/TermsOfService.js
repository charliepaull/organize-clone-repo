			<p className="c_terms__text">
				The copyright rights and other property rights to the Site and the Organize Social Networks are owned by Organize. 
				All rights regarding the content posted to the Site and the Organize Social Networks by Organize are reserved 
				by Organize. The content on the Site may not be used or disseminated without the prior written consent of Organize, 
				except that you may download spec sheets solely for the purpose of doing business with Organize. The Site and the

				reliability.
			</p>
			<p className="c_terms__text">
				Some of the information provided by Organize on the Site and the Organize Social Networks may contain projections 
				or other statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of Organize that constitute 
				“forward-looking statements” within meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Private Securities Litigation 
				Reform Act of 1995 and other related laws that provide a “safe harbor” for forward-looking statements. These 
				forward-looking statements, which may include statements that reflect our current views with respect to future 
				events and financial performance, are identified by their use of such terms and phrases as “intend,” “goal,” 
				“estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “projections,” “plans,” “anticipate,” “should,” “designed to,” “foreseeable future,” 
				“believe,” “confident,” “think,” “scheduled,” “outlook,” “guidance” and similar expressions. This list of 
				indicative terms and phrases is not intended to be all-inclusive. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance 
				on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they were made. We are not undertaking any 
				duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect developments or information obtained after 
				the date such forward-looking statements are made.
			</p>
			<p className="c_terms__text">
				Our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in forward-looking statements. Factors 
				that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (a) the general economic, political and competitive 
				conditions in the markets where we operate; (b) changes in capital availability or costs, such as changes in 
				interest rates, security ratings and market perceptions of the businesses in which we operate; (c) changes in the 
				regulatory framework governing business generally, and the telecommunication services and equipment industry in 
				particular, in the U.S. and other countries; (d) changes in authoritative generally accepted accounting principles 
				or policies from such standard-setting bodies as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Public Company 
				Accounting Oversight Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); (e) the impact of corporate governance, 
				accounting and securities law reforms by the United States Congress, the SEC or the New York Stock Exchange; 
				(f) natural and man-made catastrophes; and (g) other factors discussed in the documents we file from time to time 
				with the SEC, including specifically our most recently filed reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, as amended, 
				to which we refer you for more information regarding our forward-looking statements and risk factors.

			</p>
			<ul className="c_terms__list">
				<li className="c_terms__list__item">
					<p> 
						<i> Think twice before you publish. </i>
						<br />
						<p>
							Would you want your family, friends, colleagues, or others to 
							read or see the content you post? Keep in mind that even if original content can be deleted, the 
							content that is shared and distributed through an array of channels can be reposted, searched, and found 
							on the Internet.
						</p>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li className="c_terms__list__item">
					<i> Respect the law, including with regard to intellectual property </i>
					<br />
					<p> 
						It is critical that you show proper respect for the law generally, and specifically for the laws governing 
						copyright and fair use of copyrighted material. You should not quote more than short excerpts from someone 
						else’s work. It is good general practice to link to others’ work. Use appropriate symbols to mark the first 
						appearance of trademarked terms in your content. Do not post images, music or other copyrighted content 
						unless you own them or have permission from the owner to display such content in this context. Keep in mind 
						that the laws may differ depending on where you live.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li className="c_terms__list__item">
					<i> Treat others like you want to be treated </i>
					<br />
					<p> 
						Be respectful of others’ opinions and beliefs. Use common courtesy when posting content: refrain from 
						abusive, obscene, or offensive language, images, or links. Do not post content from, or links to, Internet 
						sites that feature sexual content, gambling, or that advocate intolerance of others; and do not create such 
						content on Organize’s Social Networks.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li className="c_terms__list__item">
					<i> Do not post confidential or proprietary information </i>
					<br />
					<p> 
						By posting content to Organize’s Social Networks, you are agreeing to allow anyone with access to 
						Organize’s Social Networks to access it and use it without restriction, except with regard to any applicable 
						intellectual property rights that you or others may have in such content. You agree that you will not post or 
						transmit material that is confidential or proprietary to you or a third-party.
